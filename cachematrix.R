## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. It creates the matrix variable x, the inverse variable i, and four nested functions for getting and setting both of these.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL 
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. If it has been cached but a new matrix is created and set, it clears the cache and computes a new cached value for i.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(i)
  i
  
}
